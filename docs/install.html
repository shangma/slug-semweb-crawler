	<h3>Installation</h3>
	
	<p>
	Installation is quite straight-forward. All required libraries and code are 
	provided in the distribution for each <a href="releases.html">release</a>, so simply:
	</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Download the desired <a href="releases.html">release</a>. Ensure that 
	  you save the file locally as some users have reported problems opening the 
	  file directly in a browser.</li>
	  <li>Unzip the distribution, e.g. in your home directory. You'll end up with 
	  a new sub-directory <code>slug</code> containing all code and files.</li>
	  <li>You may want to create a new environment variable <code>$SLUG_HOME</code> 
	  or <code>%SLUG_HOME%</code> to refer to the location of the scutter. You'll 
	  probably also want to add this directory to your PATH.</li>
	  <li>Ensure you have Java 1.5 installed, you'll need this to run the scutter</li>
	  <li>It's also recommended that you install <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a>. 
	  You'll definitely need this if you want to contribute to the project, locally customise 
	  the code, or build it yourself. The provided Ant script (<code>$SLUG_HOME/build.xml</code>) 
	  also includes a few helpful tools such as building the javadocs, etc. See the 
	  <a href="tools.html">tools documentation</a> for notes on that.</li>
	  <li>That's it, you're ready to configure and run a scutter</li>
	</ol>

	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Slug distribution includes shell scripts for running a scutter. Run <code>$SLUG_HOME/slug.sh</code> 
	or <code>slug.bat</code> depending on your platform. These scripts configure the required 
	Java <code>CLASSPATH</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
	These scripts accept the following parameters. The majority are required:
	</p>
	
	<table cols="2 rows="4" border="1">
	 <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Required?</th></tr>
	 <tr><td>-config</td><td>Path to a Slug <a href="config.html">configuration file</a></td>
	 	<td>Yes</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>-id</td><td>Identifier for scutter <a href="profiles.html">profile</code> as defined in 
	 the above config. file</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>-plan</td><td>Path to a "<a href="scutterplan.html">scutter plan</a>". i.e an RDF document 
	 identifying the list of initial URLs to be crawled. The distribution includes a 
	 simple example, <code>sample-plan.rdf</code></td><td>No, supply this or <code>-freshen</code>, or both</td></tr>
	 <tr><td>-freshen</td><td>Indicates whether the scutter should add all previously 
	 found URLs to its initial crawler plan. Used to "freshen" already discovered data</td>
	 	<td>No, supply this or <code>-plan</code>, or both</td></tr>
	</table>
