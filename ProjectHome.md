Slug is a web crawler (or [Scutter](http://wiki.foaf-project.org/Scutter)) designed for harvesting semantic web content. Implemented in Java using the Jena API, Slug provides a configurable, modular framework that allows a great degree of flexibility in configuring the retrieval, processing and storage of harvested content.

The framework provides an RDF vocabulary for describing crawler configurations and collects metadata concerning crawling activity. Crawler metadata allows for reporting and analysis of crawling progress, as well as more efficient retrieval through the storage of HTTP caching data.

For a general introduction to the framework [view this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/ldodds/slug-a-semantic-web-crawler) or read this [paper](http://slug-semweb-crawler.googlecode.com/files/slug-a-semantic-web-crawler.pdf) which covers a bit more of the crawlers design.
