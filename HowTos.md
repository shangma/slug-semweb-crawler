This page contains some notes on how to use Slug to carry out two specific tasks: build a disk cache of a portion of the Semantic Web, and how to map inter-document links

# Build a Disk Cache #

TODO, describe use of 'ResponseStorer' to cache fetch files. Explore use of rules to turn memory and a local cache into a Jena FileManager configuration.

# Map the Semantic Web #

TODO: additional docs. See 'mapping-scutter' profile in the sample config. This profile simply harvests connections between documents it doesn't store any content locally. The memory can then be processed to examine the inter-connections between documents, creating a "map" of the crawled area.
